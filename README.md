# github.com/ooni/oohttp

This repository contains a fork of Go's standard library `net/http`
package including patches to allow using this HTTP code with
[github.com/refraction-networking/utls](
https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls).

## Motivation and maintenance

We created this package [because it simplifies testing URLs using
specific TLS Client Hello messages](https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/1731). We
will continue to keep it up to date as long as it serves our goals.

## Limitations

Please, keep in mind the following limitations:

1. This fork does not include a fork of `pprof` because such package
depends on the stdlib's `internal/profile` package. If your code uses
`http/pprof`, then you cannot switch to this fork.

2. This fork's `httptrace` package is partly broken because there
is no support for network events tracing, which requires the stdlib's
`internal/nettrace` package. If your code depends on network events
tracing, then you cannot switch to this fork.

3. This fork tracks the latest stable version of Go by merging
upstream changes into the `main` branch. This means that it _may_
not be working with earlier versions of Go. For example, when
writing this note we are at Go 1.16 and this package accordingly
uses `io.ReadAll`. If you are compiling using Go 1.15, you should
get build errors because `io.ReadAll` did not exist before Go 1.16.

## Usage

To use this fork, you have two options, described below.

### Fully replacing net/http

You can simply replace

```Go
import "net/http"
```

with

```Go
import "github.com/ooni/oohttp"
```

The code will work out of the box (except for the [above-mentioned
limitations](#limitations).

### Using


## Issue tracker

Please, report issues in the [ooni/probe](https://github.com/ooni/probe)
repository. Make sure you mention `oohttp` in the issue title.

## Patches

We started from the `src/net/http` subtree at `go1.16` and we
applied patches to fork the codebase ([#1](https://github.com/ooni/oohttp/pull/1),
[#2](https://github.com/ooni/oohttp/pull/2) and [#3](
https://github.com/ooni/oohttp/pull/3)). Then, we introduced
the `http.TLSConn` abstraction that allows using different TLS
libraries ([#4](https://github.com/ooni/oohttp/pull/4)).

Every major change is documented by a pull request. We may push
minor changes (e.g., updating docs) directly on the `main` branch.

## Update procedure

(Adapted from refraction-networking/utls instructions.)

1. run the following commands:

```
git remote add golang git@github.com:golang/go.git || git fetch golang
git branch -D golang-upstream golang-http-upstream
git checkout -b golang-upstream go1.16.7
git subtree split -P src/net/http/ -b golang-http-upstream
git checkout merged-main
git merge golang-http-upstream
git push merged-main
```

2. make sure the codebase does not assume `*net.Conn` anywhere (every
merge may introduce new changes);

3. open a pull request on github and merge it with merge commit.
